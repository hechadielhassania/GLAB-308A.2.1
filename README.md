# Object-Oriented Adventure

This project is a guided activity designed to help you learn object-oriented programming principles by creating a simple adventuring game. The project is divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects of object-oriented programming and game development.

## Introduction

The Object-Oriented Adventure project provides hands-on experience in building an adventuring game using JavaScript and object-oriented programming principles. Through a series of guided exercises, you will learn how to create characters, define their properties and behaviors, manage inventories, and interact with the game world.

## Objectives

- Learn to use nested arrays and objects to organize data.
- Combine objects, arrays, and functions to build complex systems.
- Create classes to define blueprints for creating objects with shared properties and behaviors.
- Add methods to classes to encapsulate functionality.
- Set properties on class instances to represent individual characteristics.
- Develop inheritance relationships between classes to reuse code and structure.
- Implement static properties and methods for shared class-level functionality.
- Utilize factory patterns to efficiently create multiple instances of objects.
- Explore different roles and behaviors for characters in the game.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Object-Oriented Adventure project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Review the README file for instructions and guidance on completing the project.
4. Follow the prompts and exercises provided in the project to build your adventuring game.
5. Commit your changes frequently to track your progress and maintain a history of your work.
6. Experiment with your own ideas and modifications to extend the project beyond the provided exercises.

## Additional Resources

For additional resources and support, consider the following:

- Explore online tutorials and documentation related to object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
